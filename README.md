This project targets to demo authentication and authorization

Trying to create the project close to production level as possible

Switch to different branches to see different methods

Branch:

jwt-advance version: JWT token with refresh logic

oauth2: Work in progress (will be a simple oauth2 and will create a advance version later on)
